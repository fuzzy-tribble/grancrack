Grancrack was written to go with this Medium post: "A How-To Guide: Convincing your ancient(s) to practice good security"

---------------------------------

Running ./grancrack will start interactive mode by default. 
You will then be prompted for a target password and then any hints you would like to give.

Example 1: Lets say your ancient Jerry thinks his password is super clever. 
./grancrack
What is the ancient's password (required)? > JerRy47
Got any hints for me (optional)? > jerry

Example 2: Lets say your ancient thinks using her dogs name with number/letter replacements is clever.
./grancrack
What is the ancient's password (required)? > L0v3Bella4Evr
Got any hints for me (optional)? > love bella
